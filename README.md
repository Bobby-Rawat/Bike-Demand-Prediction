🚴‍♂️ Delighted to announce the completion of my latest Machine Learning project on Seoul City Bike Demand Prediction.



🎯 Objective: 
The objective of this project is to accurately predict bike rental demand in Seoul, South Korea, using machine learning techniques. By analyzing factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant variables, we aim to develop robust predictive models.


🕵 Project Insights:
1️⃣ Peak demand during summer, particularly in July.

2️⃣ Highest demand during morning (8 AM) and evening (6 PM) rush hours.

3️⃣ Increased demand when temperature exceeds 15 degrees Celsius.

4️⃣ High demand during periods of visibility above 2 km.

5️⃣ Negative impact of heavy rainfall on bike demand in the city.



🛠️ Tools Utilized: 
Utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn for machine learning, and data visualization libraries to develop the predictive model and generate insightful visuals.
